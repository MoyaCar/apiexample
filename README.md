## Create Python Environment with Conda

1. Install Conda if you haven't already. You can download it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). (Or you can use a virtual environment of your choice)

2. Run the following command to create a new environment with Python 3.12:

```bash
conda create --name globant_challenge python=3.12
conda activate globant_challenge
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
